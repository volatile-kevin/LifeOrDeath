# void mp1_poke(void);
# You can use this function to write to video memory.
#
# Interface: Register-based arguments (not C-style)
#    Inputs: %cl  - The byte you wish to write
#            %eax - Offset from the start of video memory that you wish
#                   to write to
#   Outputs: Text-mode video screen is written to at location %eax with
#            the byte in %cl
# Registers: Clobbers EDX
